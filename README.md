* Design

    + Colour scheme:
        
        - The colours chosen were picked using the [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/) extension on Google Chrome to pick out the colours used in the imagery provided for use on the website. A dark gray colour was picked from the background of the main logo image to use for continuity purposes in different sections of the website, providing a seamless quality between images and background. A pink hue and a blue hue offering sufficient contrast between the background grey and any lettering used were also picked from the hero image using the Eye Dropper.

    + Typography:

        - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to source the main fonts used on this website.
        - The Sacramento font was used for the navigation bar writing and section headers as it most closely resembled the handwritten style of the main logo, whilst also being readable.
        - The Josefin Sans font was used for the writing on the rest of the website, in order to make the smaller fonts more readable.
        - Sans Serif was chosen as the fallback font in case either of the above fonts failed to be imported.
        - This [website](https://kevq.uk/whats-in-a-font-researching-website-typography/) was consulted when making choices regarding the typography to the used on the website.

    + Imagery:

        - The images chosen were commissioned by the artist for use in social media websites and other marketing materials, including this website. They include a title banner displaying the word "Saccharyn" in a glow neon-pink and a main image of a bust of the artist also in a glow neon-pink with blue and pink background details. Both images have the same very dark grey background colour, which ties the style together. 
        - The title banner was used as a header whereas the bust image was used as a hero image.
        - Imagery is very important as it ties together with all marketing materials relating to the artist, including social media profiles and pages on services such as [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7BrG3qmLmDp8B30dzd657d).
