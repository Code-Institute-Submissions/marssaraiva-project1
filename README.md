* Design

    + Colour scheme:
        
        - The colours chosen were picked using the [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/) extension on Google Chrome to pick out the colours used in the imagery provided for use on the website. A dark gray colour was picked from the background to use for continuity purposes for the background of the different sections of the website, providing a seamless quality between images and background. A pink hue and a blue hue which offered sufficient contrast between the background grey and any lettering used were also picked using the Eye Dropper.

    + Imagery:

        - The images chosen were commissioned by the artist for use in social media websites and other marketing materials, including this website. They include a title banner displaying the word "Saccharyn" in a glow neon-pink and a main image of a bust of the artist also in a glow neon-pink with blue and pink background details. Both images have the same very dark grey background colour, which ties the style together. 
        - The title banner was used as a header whereas the bust image was used as a hero image.
        - Imagery is very important as it ties together with all marketing materials relating to the artist, including social media profiles and pages on services such as [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7BrG3qmLmDp8B30dzd657d).
