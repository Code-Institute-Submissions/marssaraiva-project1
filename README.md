This is the main website for a musician called Saccharyn. It is designed to be accessible and responsive across different devices. The style is simple in order to make it easy for fans and potential music industry professionals to easily find information relating to the musician's live show dates, social media profiles and media content.

* Design

    + Colour scheme:
        
        - The colours chosen were picked using the [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/) extension on Google Chrome to pick out the colours used in the imagery provided for use on the website. A dark gray colour was picked from the background of the main logo image to use for continuity purposes in different sections of the website, providing a seamless quality between images and background. A pink hue and a blue hue offering sufficient contrast between the background grey and any lettering used were also picked from the hero image using the Eye Dropper.

        ---

    + Typography:

        - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to source the main fonts used on this website.
        - The Sacramento font was used for the navigation bar writing and section headers as it most closely resembled the handwritten style of the main logo, whilst also being readable.
        - The Josefin Sans font was used for the writing on the rest of the website, in order to make the smaller fonts more readable.
        - Sans Serif was chosen as the fallback font in case either of the above fonts failed to be imported.
        - This [website](https://kevq.uk/whats-in-a-font-researching-website-typography/) was consulted when making choices regarding the typography to the used on the website. 

        ---

    + Imagery:

        - The image chosen was commissioned by the artist for use in social media websites and other marketing materials, including this website. The image is that of a bust of the artist in a neon-pink glow outline with blue and pink background details. The image has a very dark grey background colour, which is used throughout the body of the website to create a seamless effect.
        - The bust image was used as a hero image.
        - Imagery is very important as it ties together with all marketing materials relating to the artist, including social media profiles and pages on services such as [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7BrG3qmLmDp8B30dzd657d).

        ---

    + Responsiveness:
    
        - The website design is minimalist by nature, so I wanted to keep the design fairly similar for different device sizes.
        - The main difference between desktop and mobile device design is the positioning of the title "Saccharyn" and the navigation menu links. In larger screen sizes the title is floated to the left and the navigation menu is floated to the right. In smaller screen sizes the title sits on top of the navigation menu.
        - A "burger" menu button was considered for small (under 480px) screen sizes, however, as there are only 3 items on the navigation menu, which fit neatly even in smaller screen sizes, it was deemed that it would be better user experience with fewer clicks to have the full meny displayed on screen rather than the extra clicks to open the burger menu with the options.
        - As the website develops and expands in future, a "burger" menu will be considered for smaller screens as the navigation menu item number also expands (for instance to include a "News" section).

## Testing

* Bugs Discovered

    + Navigation logo issue:

        - An image was provided of the word 'Saccharyn' written in neon pink to be used as the logo for the header of the website, however this image did not fit with the style of the header bar, as it was too small for its purpose and increasing its size meant increasing the height of the header, pushing the hero image further down, which affected the overall design of the page.

        - The logo image was resized and moved around, cropped and resized, however the issue persisted. It was also found during this process that the colours used in this logo differed from the colours used in the hero image, which looked inconsistent when generating the colour palette for the website.

        - As a result it was decided that the logo image would be replaced by text styled with CSS using the colour palette from the hero image to be consistent with the pink neon light effect by using a text-shadow property. This also meant a hover pseudo-class could be employed to alter the colour of the text logo when being hovered over, which was not possible with a static image.

        - Overall using text was found to be a more elegant solution for making the website more consistent, whilst also looking better in terms of design, improving user experience.

        - In future a new logo will be commissioned with different parameters to fit the spcifications of the website design, as the original logo provided was designed as a cover image for social media websites such as [Twitter](www.twitter.com), [Instagram](www.instagram.com) and [Facebook](www.facebook.com), and not designed with a website in mind.

    + Blue line near social media icons:
        - When hovering over the social media icons there was an unwanted blue line appearing to the right of the highlighted icon. I googled the issue and this appears to be a common issue when hovering over Font Awesome icons. I used the code suggesed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21983508/strange-underlines-in-font-awesome-css) which fixed the issue.

        ---

    + Padding issue on footer:
        - I noticed the footer icons were not centred properly on the screen and were pushed up further from the bottom of the screen than intended. Using Dev Tools on Chrome I noticed there was a 40px padding on the left pushing the icons off-centre and also 1rem margin pushing the icons up. I overrode this padding and margin inherited from Bootstrap for ul elements by specifying padding and margin as 0 in the class selected for the footer in the stylesheet.

        ---
        
    + Centering issue with nav in media query:
        - I was initially unable to center the menu bar when using a media query for screens smaller in width than 1024px by using the text-align property, as Bootstrap styling overrode this to justify the nav elements to the right. I used Dev Tools on Chrome to view the specifc rule being applied to this, which was "justify-content: flex-end!important;". I overrode this by specifying in the media query section for the .justify-content-end class "justify-content: center!important;". I needed to add the "!important" part in order for the media query to override the Bootstap style.

    + Comments:
        - My mentor had an error when opening the Instagram link from the website, however as my mentor is located in a different part of the world this may have been due to a server issue in his location. He was able to fix this error however by force refreshing his page.
        - The newsletter form has been programmed with a landing page for aesthetic purposes and there is no working backend for this form, however this will be added to the final website once I have the skills to do so later in the programme.
